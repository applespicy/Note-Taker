# Note Taker Starter Code
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

It is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, 
and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
Mock-Up

I created a server side application that dynamically generates a Note taker from a user's input  The application will be invoked with the following command: node server.js

 This Application is been deployed HEROKU, here is a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nW6unKi3RwRvM6vaanGTfa5ztUhQxHQ3/view" to a video walkthrough that demonstrates the functionality of my application.
